<p> NEW SCHOOL CANTEEN </p>

<img src="https://www.theconstructionindex.co.uk/assets/press/2011/05/1305189010_harwich-school1-jpg.jpg">

<p> The school canteen is conceived as an additional form of health education because it encourages the development of
	hygiene habits and promotes good nutrition. Another advantage is that children learn to use cutlery and napkins
	properly as well as to adopt a good body posture when eating.It is essential that children eat well, but on more
	than one occasion, meals become a big battlefield. This generates anxiety and rejection, which can affect other
	aspects of our relationship with them. </p>
